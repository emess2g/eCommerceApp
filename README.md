In this tutorial we will create an eCommerce website / Web App using React JS and Tailwind CSS.
We will create the Home page where we will display the Latest products, best selling products, newsletter subscription box and Footer.
We will also make products collection page to display all products added on this online shopping website.
On this product collection page we will create product filter, product sort and product search features also.
Then we will create the product page where it will display product image gallery, title, price, description, add to cart button and Related products. After that we will create Place Order page, Cart page, My Order List page, About Page, Contact Page, Login and Signup page. After completing this ecommerce website for customers, we will create the website for admin.
Where admin can add new products on website, list and delete the products, display and update the orders.
To build this E-commerce website we will use React JS & Tailwind CSS.
After completing this front-end eCommerce project, we will build the backend in the next tutorial, To create the back-end we will use Node JS, Express, MongoDB and React JS. So this is going to be a MERN Stack Ecommerce Project.
